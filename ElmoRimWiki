# The Hitchhikers Guide To ElmoRim
  
## Gameplay

ElmoRim is centered around vanilla content. As such, anyone familiar with Skyrim should be able to jump right in and start playing after reading about the mods listed below. 

 ### ElmoRim Control scheme:
  - The ElmoRim keyboard control scheme might seem a bit unorthodox at a glance. It is inspired by the excellent [Streamlined Skyrim](https://github.com/TerribleBrad/Streamlined-Skyrim/blob/main/README.md) modlist and offers a compact layout. While it certainly can be modified, it is recommended that users give it a try. Much thought has gone into tweaking the controls to allow quick and easy access to all necessary actions.  

  - ElmoRim features mods that support playing with a controller. However, no pre-configured control scheme is provided and users are encouraged to create their own setup.
  
 ![Keyboard](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ElmoDFGD/ElmoRim/3c345525a25aa963c83edc21d4ff4cc60fae5986/media/ElmoRim%20Keyboard.jpg)
  
![Mouse](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ElmoDFGD/ElmoRim/main/media/ElmoRim%20Mouse.png)

  >Control layout may differ between systems and need to be reconfigured. This can be done in-game for all actions except power attacks:
  >
  >* Execute button is defined in the Valhalla Combat MCM.
  >* Target lock is defined in the True Directional Movement MCM.
  >
  >Power attacks are configured in OneClickPowerAttack.ini in the mod One Click Power Attack. Change *ForceRightKey* to the appropriate key. DX scan codes can be found [here](https://www.creationkit.com/index.php?title=Input_Script#DXScanCodes). 

#### Lamas Tiny Hud:
The combat in ElmoRim is a lot more fast paced than vanilla Skyrim. This means a new system for smoothly switching between sets of weapons/spells/powers on the fly is needed. [Lamas Tiny Hud](link) is compact, responsive and easy to configure.

An overview of it's functions:

* A total of 8 equip sets can be configured. 
* The widget displays 4 sets at a time. Switch by pressing the *Toggle key*. Default `5`  

To edit a set (or page, as the author calls it):
* Hold corresponding key. 
  - Default key: `1` for left
  - Default key: `2` for top
  - Default key: `3` for right
  - Default key: `4` for bottom
* When a message is displayed in the top right corner, open up the inventory/spells menu.
* Add items/spells/powers by equipping them in the left/right hand.
* Exit editing mode by pressing the same key again.
 
 >Read the modpage carefully and experiment in game. It takes a while to get used to this way of equipping, but it offers a flexibility far superior to vanilla. 
 
 > SPECIAL CASE: Switching from sets with spells in off-hand to a set with only a **one-handed** weapon in the right hand + **empty** left hand is best done using SKYUI's group functions. Group 1 is preconfigured to support this.

  ### ElmoRim Combat:  
ElmoRim comes with all the bells and whistles in this department. 
* [Attack - MCO|DXP](https://www.skyrim-guild.com/mods/attack) creates a smooth flow by adding movement to all attack animations. 
>One feature of Attack - MCO|DXP is that all non-power attacks are now performed via LMB. RMB is for blocking and casting spells equipped in the left hand.
* [Precision](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/72347) provides a sense of impact by fixing hitboxes, adding weapon trails and implementing hitstop animations.
* [Valhalla Combat](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/64741) overhauls Stamina management to encourage a high paced playstyle. It also features an unparallelled timed block function and and a stun/execute system.  
* [One Click Power Attack](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/60878) introduces a separate key for performing power attacks, giving the player control over what happens and when. Default key: `MB4`
* [SCAR - Skyrim Combos AI Revolution](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/72014) makes enemies use attacks in the same way that MCO does for the player.
* [TK Dodge RE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/56956) adds dodging. Default key: `Spacebar`
* [Valravn - Integrated Combat of Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/53869) Adds attacks of opportunity (such as attacking a staggered opponent) and brings a number of balance improvements.
* [Elden Counter](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/65579) Adss the ability to perform a counter attack after blocking a hit akin to Elden Rings guard counter. Simply press the power attack button after a successful block.

### ElmoRim Lite Needs:
One goal of ElmoRim is to increase immersion without adding complexity. To this end, ElmoRim comes with a unique setup for survival elements, seamlessly integrated into the general gameplay. 

#### Sleep
The mod [Incremental Injuries](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/55114) introduces the need to sleep organically by reducing max Magicka/Health/Stamina as they are spent. They are restored by sleeping 6+ hours in-game. 

  >By default, ElmoRim also uses the mods [Incremental Gains](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/67270) & [Hardcore Level Up - Incremental Gains Addon](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/72741) which increase max Magicka/Health/Stamina by a small amount each time the player sleeps. The attributes increase proportionally to how much they were reduced before sleeping. 
  >
  >This replaces the vanilla attribute progression. Selecting an attribute upon levelling up will now only increase that attribute by one point.
  >
  >These two mods can be disabled if the vanilla system is preferred.

#### Eat/Drink
[Apothecary - Food and Drink Addon](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/52130) alters food and drink to make them give long lasting passive regeneration buffs. The buffs are very well balanced and incentivize eating and drinking regularly without making the buffs OP.   

#### Cold
The cold system from [Sunhelm - Survival and Needs](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/39414) is used to reward preparation and increase immersion. Other Sunhelm mechanics are disabled.

#### Camping 
[Camping Lite](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2370) is a lightweight mod that provides an option for pitching a tent & lighting a fire for warmth/cooking. 

#### Carry Weight 

ElmoRim limits the player to 150 points of carry capacity. The only way to increase this limit is through perks, gear, standing stones, spells **or** crafting a [Simple Leather Backpack](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42455). Be wary though, while backpacks help fit that final piece of sliced cheese into the players inventory, they also come with a [Backpack Penalty](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/57206). This penalty heavily reduces stamina regeneration in combat. *In essence, backpacks are meant to carry loot out of dungeons - not into them.*

### Experience:
[Experience](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17751) changes how levelling works in Skyrim. Instead of player level being tied to skill level, experience is now earned through completing quests, discovering new locations and killing enemies.

### Simplest Horses:
The best mod for horse management in Skyrim. [Simplest Horses](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/54225) gives the player the ability to have the horse follow,wait and stash items with a single button. If the crosshair is aimed at the horse, pressing the button opens the horses inventory. Otherwise it triggers the horse whistle, telling the horse to wait/follow.

### Quest mods
ElmoRim does not bring any massive new quest mods to Skyrim. Instead the list improves vanilla quests by enhancing consistency, timing and player choices.

- [At Your Own Pace](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/52704) improves the pacing of the game by delaying quest progression until certain conditions are met. The conditions can be tweaked in the MCM.

- [College For Non-Mages](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/40430) tweaks the classroom scene in the quest [First Lessons](https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki/First_Lessons), giving the players the option of progressing the questline without being forced to learn a ward spell.
> Be careful not to skip any dialogue as it could break the scene.

## What I Wish I Knew When I First Played ElmoRim
***GET OP EARLY ESSENTIAL BEGINNERS TIPS ONE SHOT GUIDE***

In all seriousness, ElmoRim plays pretty close to vanilla and this wiki accounts for any notable differences. However it always helps to have a plan when starting a new playthrough.

 1. Craft a Camping Kit ASAP.
* 2 x Wolf Pelt
* 1 x Iron Ingot
* 6 x Leather
* 6 x Leather Strips
* Craft at any forge

2. The manual for crafting Backpacks can be found outside the Drunken Huntsman in Whiterun.

3. Bring a Woodcutter's Axe & gear suitable for cold weather.

4. Buy a horse - they are useful for traversing the landscape and can carry a good bit of loot.

5. Don't loot everything in sight - carry weight is limited.

6. Quick Light is useful - use it.

7. If the enemy's healthbar is flashing and a metallic sound plays, they can be executed. `Default key: MB3`

8. Vampires assaulting the Dawnguard base should bring a bow.

9. Enemies with a gray stamina bar can easily be staggered while they are blocking.

10. Don't try and tackle vampire lairs at level one. Check the [Arena](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/33487) modpage to get a sense of approriate levels for different dungeons/quests.

11. Skyrim is a troubled place - [Sidequests Of Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/54245?tab=description) let's the player ask anyone if they need help.

12. [Dragon Claws Auto-Unlock](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/47329) all puzzle doors. Just activate a keyhole while carrying its matching claw.

# Tweaking the Game Settings

## BethINI

To get some more FPS or better visuals, tweak the following values in BethINI.

- `Visuals>Grass Density`: Change to 60 for more FPS or 20 for more dense grass

The best AA in Skyrim is higher resolution. If the game runs smoothly at 1080p@60FPS, increasing the resolution is an option. This is done in *SSEDisplayTweaks.ini* in the mod *SSE Display Tweaks - High Performance Configuration*.
- `Resolution`: Change to 2560x1440
> ElmoRim doesn't utilize borderless upscaling. As such the monitor's resolution must be set to match the chosen game resolution.

## LOD
By default, ElmoRim ships with an LOD based on the *High* settings profile in DynDOLOD. This is a massive improvement over vanilla LOD, both in terms of visual consistency as well as quality. Users looking to increase FPS can [generate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=encZYHEeQrQ) new LODs with *medium* or *low*.
> Make sure to disable all mods under the *Map*-separator before generating LOD.

## Grass
 Users who want to completley tank their FPS can generate LODs with distant grass. To generate grass LOD, follow these [instructions](https://dyndolod.info/Help/Grass-LOD). ElmoRim comes with a grass cache already set up. 
 To improve performance, make these changes to *Grasscontrol.config.txt* in the mod *No Grass In Objects*:
- `UseGrassCache`: Set to false
- `ExtendGrassDistance`: Set to false
- `OnlyLoadFromCache`: Set to false
- `DynDOLODGrassMode`: Set to 0

## Skyrim Upscaler 
The upscaling is set to *Balanced* by default. Press `End` to toggle the UI and alter the quality. 
- `Quality level`: Set to Performance to increase FPS.



# Development
## Known Issues
Everything is tracked using the GitHub [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/ElmoDFGD/ElmoRim/issues). Check this page before reporting any suspected bugs. If the issue in question isn't listed, feel free to register a new one.

## Roadmap
ElmoRim development going forward will almost exclusively be about fixing bugs and improving what is already there. The attentative reader will probably have noticed my aversion to new content. The reason for this is simple: Creating an engaging storyline and backing it up with solid voice acting is HARD. These things are professions for a reason.

For all my years of modding Skyrim I have only found three mods that deliver a solid narrative and don't give me the heebie-jeebies when listening to their voice acting. 

* [Legacy of the Dragonborn](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11802)
* [Inigo](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1461)
* [The Forgotten City](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1179)

So IF new content is added to ElmoRim, it will be these mods.

Anyway, here are the current plans for ElmoRim:

### Now
* Bug fixes
* Difficulty balancing
* Visuals and performance

### Later
* Tweak animations

### Someday, maybe
* Add non-heebie-jeebie-content
* Animated Armory
* Missives/The notice board
* Honed Metal 1
