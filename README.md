## What is ElmoRim?  
ElmoRim is a **compact**, **performance friendly** list for those who want to play *Skyrim*, and nothing else, in the year 2022.  The list features **improved visuals**, **modernized combat** and **increased immersion** to offer an enhanced rather than expanded Skyrim. No complex new mechanics or massive content additions are included, instead favouring tweaks and improvements that let the vanilla content shine. 

## Feature Overview
ElmoRim consists of around 600 mods. This overview provides an idea of what to expect from the list.

The full modlist can be viewed [here](123).


## System Requirements

### Minimum Specifications for ~60 fps gameplay at 1920x1080

>  Please note these specs are the best idea of a baseline that I can provide at the current moment, based on feedback I have gotten from testers and my own experiences. In the future this will be updated depending on feedback received.

| Spec Category | Default Profile |
|     :---:    |     :---:     |
| **CPU**   | R7 3700x / i5 10600k |  
| **Video Card**    | RTX 3060 Ti / RTX 2070 / RX 6700 XT       |
| **Ram**    | 16gb (2x16) DDR4 3200mhz RAM     |
| **Storage**    | SATA SSD     |


Modlist size: 
- X GB (of which Y GB are downloads)
  
### Setting Up Pagefile

Due to the resources required to run modlists like these, you will need to configure the pagefile on your system in order to avoid crashes and bugs that may occur from running out of memory. This step is **NOT** optional, I do not care how much RAM or VRAM you have, please do this step.
  I suggest a 40GB fixed-size pagefile for ElmoRim solely for safety, but it is very possible that you could get away with a 20GB (20480 instead of 40960 in the **Initial** and **Maximum Size** boxes). While a 20GB pagefile may be usable, I do not plan on testing it any time soon, so do so at your own risk.

To set up your pagefile:
1. Press **Win Key + R**
2. Type *sysdm.cpl ,3* and hit **ENTER**
3. Navigate to *Performance* and click the box "Settings..."
4. Click the *Advanced* tab at the top
5. Under *Virtual Memory* click the box "Change..."
6. Uncheck *Automatically manage* if it is checked
7. Select your disk drive, ideally your fastest solid state drive
8. Click the **Custom size:** button
9. In the box next to **Initial Size (MB)** type 40960
10. In the box next to **Maximum Size (MB)** type 40960
11. Click the *Set* button
12. Click *OK*
13. Click *Apply*
14. Click *OK*
15. Restart your computer in order for your new pagefile to take effect.

## Installation

Installing ElmoRim is easy, especially if you have Nexus Premium account.

### Pre-Installation

Prior to installing ElmoRim, please complete the following steps.

1. Install [Visual C++ x64](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe) & [.Net Runtime v6 desktop x64](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0/runtime).
2. Change Skyrim so it does not [automatically update](https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/71AB-698D-57EB-178C#disable).
3. Right click on Skyrim SE and click on properties, untick the "Enable Steam Overlay while in-game."

#### Setting Shader Cache Size

### Wabbajack Installation

#### Installing Wabbajack

Once you have completed pre-installation, download the [latest version of Wabbajack]((https://github.com/wabbajack-tools/wabbajack/releases)) on this github and place it in a folder such as `C:\Wabbajack`. **DO NOT place it in Program Files, User folders (such as Desktop, Documents, Downloads, etc.), or in your Skyrim's Steam folder**. I recommend placing it on an SSD.

#### Downloading and Installing 

Downloading and installing ElmoRim can take a while depending on your internet connection and computer. To install ElmoRim, complete the following steps.

1. Open Wabbajack and click `Browse Modlists`
2. Tick on the `Show Unofficial lists` option in the top right corner of Wabbajack
3. Press the download button on ElmoRim and wait for it to download.
4. Set the installation folder to be somewhere like C:\Games\ElmoRim. **DO NOT place it in Program Files, User folders (such as Desktop, Documents, Downloads, etc.), or in your Skyrim's Steam folder**
> The download location does not need to be on a SSD, but it makes installing faster.
5. Press the play button to begin.
7. If the installation is successful, jump for joy and move onto [post installation](#post-installation). If the installation is unsuccessful, follow what is below.

### Problems with installation

It is possible that you may encounter an error with Wabbajack when installing. Some common issues are listed below.

- Could not download x:
	- Big files can fail to download due to connection issues. You can either run wabbajack again or download the file manually. If you decide to manually download it, make sure to place it in the same place as the other downloads.

- **X** is not a whitelisted download:

	 - This may happen when the modlist is being updated. Please check if there is a new update or wait until you see a release ping.

- Wabbajack could not find my game folder:

	- Either buy the game or go back to the [Pre-Installation](#pre-installation) step.

- Antivirus reports a virus:
	- Windows 10/11 may automatically quarantine a key file which is needed for Mod Organizer. You can fix this by [adding an exclusion for Mod Organizer in windows defender](https://www.thewindowsclub.com/exclude-a-folder-from-windows-security-scan).

## Post-Installation and Optional Setup

### Game Folder

ElmoRim uses a Wabbajack feature called Stock Game to keep your Skyrim installation clean. All the files that you need to run the list are in a folder called `Stock Game`. You donâ€™t need to copy anything at all.

### Antivirus Exceptions

Generally speaking, using Windows Defender is advised as it is a solid antivirus software that will have minimal interference with the game. Antivirus programs can be notorious for false flagging MO2's VFS as problematic, causing crashes or other problems. 

If you use Windows Defender, it is advised that you set up an Exception for the modlist. To do this follow these steps.
 1. Press the Windows Key.
 2. Type "Windows Defender" in the search bar and select "Windows Security".
 3. Click on "Virus & threat protection" in the left pane.
 4. Click the "Manage settings" option under "Viruse & threat protection settings".
 5. Scroll down to "Exclusions" and click "Add or remove exclusions".
 6. Windows Defender will prompt you with a run as administrator screen, just hit yes.
 7. Click the "Add an exclusion" button at the top and choose "Folder".
 8. Navigate to your Install folder for the list and click "Select Folder".
 9. **(OPTIONAL)** You can repeat these steps for the ModOrganizer.exe (`Path to Modlist`\ModOrganizer.exe), the Nemesis Executable (`Path to Modlist`\mods\Project New Reign - Nemesis Unlimited Behavior Engine\Nemesis_Engine\Nemesis Unlimited Behavior Engine.exe), and Synthesis (`Path to Modlist`\tools\Synthesis\Synthesis.exe)

### Widescreen Fixes

ElmoRim offers some mods to provide (potential) Ultrawide and Widescreen Support. Under the **(Possible) Ultrawide Support** Separator in MO2 you will find some mods that you will want to activate if you are playing on Ultrawide or Widescreen resolutions (21:9 or 32:9).

**IN ORDER FOR THESE FIXES TO WORK YOU NEED TO DO THE FOLLOWING**
 1. Search for **Nordic UI XXX Patch** (XXX being the "21 by 9" or "32 by 9" depending on your screen resolution) in the left pane of MO2 and delete or hide the following files:  

    a. /interface/skyui/bottombar.swf  
    b. /interface/skyui/itemcard.swf  
 2. Search for **Experience** in the left pane of MO2 and delete or hide the following files:  
    a. /interface/statsmenu.swf  
 3. Search for **Compass Navigation Overhaul** in the left pane of MO2 and open the .ini file, `CompassNavigationOverhaul.ini` and edit the following line(s):  
    a. PositionX=-0.127  
![](https://github.com/aljoxo/ElmoRim/blob/main/Media/CNO%20UW%201.png)
 4. Once in game, navigate to the *TrueHUD* MCM Menu, and change the following values:

## Playing the List

### Obligatory DAR Cache warning: due to the nature of this list and the amount of DAR based animations it uses, it does take some time (usually 15-30 seconds) at the start of each play session for DAR to cache all the folders and animations. While cleaning up the folder setup to try and alleviate this issue is a long term goal for the list, please do realize that this issue is out of our control as it is an issue with DAR itself since it does not allow for pre-cacheing animations via Nemesis or during loading screens. If you complain about this in the discord, on nexus, or on the github page, you will be linked back here.

### Starting the Game

 - Head over to the installation folder and locate an executable named ModOrganizer.exe and launch it. If a message Registry Key does not match appear, press Yes. Once it's launched, there will be a dropdown box on the top right and a big run button next to it.

 ![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1008052853002219683/1020222827938463764/RegistryKey.png)

 
 - Launch the "ElmoRim" Executable in MO2

### Gameplay Guide
With two notable exceptions, ElmoRim stays true to vanilla gameplay. As such, anyone familiar with Skyrim should be able to jump right in and start playing.

***Skyrim Unbound***
 - ElmoRim uses [Skyrim Unbound](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27962) as the alternate start mod.
    - In order to start chargen hit **Enter** as soon as you load in
        - If your character seems to be frozen during RaceMenu, just swap race or gender and swap back, it should unfreeze them. This is an issue with DAR Cacheing.
    - Once you are finished with chargen, feel free to open up the **Skyrim Unbound** MCM menu and customize your Standing Stone, whether or not you're a vampire/werewolf, equipment, spells, and starting location.
        - You may also want to choose whether or not your character is the Dragonborn; and if they are not, whether or not they are able to use shouts.
     - Once you are finished choosing your options for the Alternate Start you desire, hit **Enter** again and choose **Continue**.
 - Read the Control map.

***ElmoRim Lite Survival***
Elmorim comes with a unique setup for survival elemets, seamlessly integrated into the general gameplay. 

**Sleep**: The mod [Incremental Injuries](link) introduces the need to sleep organically by reducing total Magicka/Health/Stamina as they are spent. 
They are restored by sleeping 6+ hours in-game. 

**Eat/Drink**: The mod [Apothecary - Food and Drink Addon](link) alters food and drink to give long lasting, passive regeneration buffs. The buffs are very well balanced to incentivize eating and drinking regularly without making the buffs OP.

**Cold**: The cold system from [Sunhelm - Survival and Needs](link) is used to reward preparation. Other Sunhelm mechanics are disabled.

**Camping**: [Camping Lite](link) is an excellent, lightweight mod that provides an option for pitching a tent & lighting a fire for warmth/cooking. 

### In-Game MCM options

 - **Skyrim Unbound**: Choose your Standing Stone, starting location, starting equipment, starting wealth, etc. By default, the player is set to become Dragonborn, so if you do not want that for some reason, turn it off. 
     - Dragons by default are set to appear after 7 to 21 days, and will appear at word walls before appearing in the wild. If you wish to make them spawn faster/slower/instantly or want to make them spawn based on level instead, you can change it here.
 - **Better Third Person Selection**: Enables the filters to reduce the possibility that the player character accidentally steals items when trying to interact with the world. Turn these filters off if you do not like them.
 - **Favourite Howls Menu**: Customize which powers will be in your favorites menu (for werewolves).
 - **Hide Your Quests**: Allows you to hide quests from your journal (not useful on startup, obviously).
 - **Improved Alternate Conversation Camera**: Tweak the dialogue camera here.
     - Notable settings include: Switch Target (for Witcher-Style Dialogue Camera), Force Third/First Person, Camera Offsets.
 - **Optimal Potion Hotkey**: Change your *Health potion hotkey* (Default: `H`). Add a hotkey for stamina/magicka potions.
 - **Simplest Horses**: Change your *Horse Control hotkey* here (Default: `V`).
 - **SmoothCam**: By default the list uses [Adventurer's Preset](link).
 - **SunHelm**: Go to ***Profiles>Browse.*** Select the ElmoRim Profile. Press Load. Next, go to ***General settings>Hotkeys>Enable/Disable powers*** to remove the redundant spells added by Sunhelm.
 - **Survival Control Panel**: Optionally disable Sleep to level up.   
 - **True Directional Movement**: Change your *Target Lock* keybind here.
 - **Valhalla Combat**: The core of the combat balance in the list. 
    - Stamina: The settings here have been configured for what has been determined to be the most balanced gameplay. Feel free to tweak them to your liking. Please note that dTry's Exhaustion system is disabled due to causing enemy aggression problems and it was decided it would be better if it was off.
    - Timed Block: You can enable or disable the *Tackle* mechanic (Default: `enabled`).
    - Stun&Execution: By default the list disables dTry's stun system as it is not well balanced right now.
      - *TrueHUD API* should say "Not Obtained" next to it, this is due to disabling the Stun System. 

### Anniversary Edition

Wabbajack [downgrades](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/57618) your install for you to version (1.5.97) of Skyrim. Please **do not** downgrade your steam install or the modlist yourself.

## Updating the modlist

Before updating, please check the [changelog](https://github.com/aljoxo/ElmoRim/blob/main/ElmoRimChangelog.md) and back up your saves. You may need to start a new game after certain updates. If you are curious to know if an update is save safe or not, then refer to the version number. The first digit should indicate major version, second digit should indicate minor version (these are likely to be save safe unless otherwise specified), the third digit will mostly represent bug fixes, etc.
  - If the modlist is updated from `1.0.0` to `2.0.0`, then this version is likely a major overhaul of at least one system and **will not** be considered save safe.
  - If the modlist is updated from `1.0.0` to `1.1.0`, then this version is **not** save safe.
  - If the modlist is updated from `1.0.0` to `1.0.1`, then this version is unlikely to be save safe, **unless** the changelog specifically says so. In cases where the update **is** save safe, you will need to perform additional steps to maintain the health of your save.  
  - If the modlist is updated from `1.0.0.0` to `1.0.0.1`, then this version is a hotfix and 100% save safe.

Updating is like installing the list. Simply make sure your paths are the same and tick the `overwrite existing modlist` button. **Note**: Any mods you have added will be deleted when updating. To make sure that Wabbajack does not delete your added mods upon updating, prefix your mods with **[NoDelete]**.

**ALWAYS** back up saves before an update. Because of the method Wabbajack uses to include the start save, any save within the profile will be wiped. 

*Please make sure you back up your saves if you plan on continuing a playthrough across a **save safe** update.*

## FAQ 

#### Q: I can't level up, what do I do?  
A: You have Sleep to level up enabled, go sleep in a bed or disable it through Survival Control Panel.

#### Q: How do I start the main questline?  
A: If you have chosen to be Dragonborn in the Skyrim Unbound MCM settings, then upon killing your first dragon, you will be summoned by the Greybeards. If you have chosen to not be the Dragonborn, then you can not proceed with the main questline.

#### Q: When do dragons start spawning?  
A: By default, dragons are set to be delayed in their spawns from 7 to 21 days after you leave the starting room. By default, dragons will begin showing up at their Word Walls before you will encounter them in the wild.

#### Q: How do I become the Thane of Whiterun? How do I get Lydia?  
A: You must complete [The Blessings of Nature](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:The_Blessings_of_Nature) quest and talk to Jarl Balgruuf when the Gildergreen tree is repaired/the sappling blooms. He'll thank you and allow you to buy the Breezehome, and the standard thaneship quest (help people of the hold and buy a house to become a thane) will be available.

#### Q: How do I enable my crosshair?
A: Disable the `Contextual Crosshair` mod, under the "Heads Up Display (HUD)" Separator in MO2.

### Tweaking the Game Settings

#### BethINI

To get some more FPS, tweak the following value in the detail section in BethINI.

- `Shadow Resolution`: 1024
- `Grass Density`: 60
- `Remove Shadows`: I really donâ€™t recommend turning this on, but if you must, then you can.

If you want to tweak your ENB to improve performance, consider looking at Annakin's [ENB Tips](https://github.com/The-Animonculory/Modding-Resources/blob/main/ENB%20Tips.md) guide. 

To quote her, here is a short answer to improve performance with an ENB turned on.
> #### How can I improve performance?
> - Uncheck `EnableLens`.
> - Uncheck `EnableBloom`.
> - Uncheck `EnableDepthofField`.
> - Uncheck `EnableTessellation` in `WATER`.
> - Uncheck `ComplexFireLights` and `ComplexFireLights` OR
>   - Uncheck `EnableBigRange` in these two settings.

## Removing the Modlist
Simply delete the folder, and you have uninstalled it.
