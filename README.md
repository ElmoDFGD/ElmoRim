I really like using markdown.

I think i'll use it to format all my files from now on.

This is the first line.
And this is the second line

I just love **bold text**.

A cat *meow*.

This is ***really*** important.

>Help me with block quotes please.
>Second line of block quotes.
>>And this is a nested block quote.
> - And here is a bullet point in the block.

1. List starts here
2. List keeps going
4. Last item on list
3. **Actual** last item on list

- list of stuff
  - Indented item
  - Next indentation
- Back to main list 

- \.1337 is a great number

Happy boy learning `markdown`.

``backticks are `tricky` ``
