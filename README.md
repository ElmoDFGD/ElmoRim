The Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality

$$\left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k b_k \right)^2 \leq \left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k^2 \right) \left( \sum_{k=1}^n b_k^2 \right)$$

This sentence uses $ delimiters to show math inline: $\sqrt{3x-1}+(1+x)^2$

~~this is not a pipe~~

As Kanye West said:

We're living the future so the present is our past.

function fancyAlert(arg) {
  if(arg) {
    $.facebox({div:'#foo'})
  }
}

You can render UML diagrams using Mermaid. For example, this will produce a sequence diagram:

sequenceDiagram
Alice ->> Bob: Hello Bob, how are you?
Bob-->>John: How about you John?
Bob--x Alice: I am good thanks!
Bob-x John: I am good thanks!
Note right of John: Bob thinks a long<br/>long time, so long<br/>that the text does<br/>not fit on a row.

Bob-->Alice: Checking with John...
Alice->John: Yes... John, how are you?
And this will produce a flow chart:

graph LR
A[Square Rect] -- Link text --> B((Circle))
A --> C(Round Rect)
B --> D{Rhombus}
C --> D
And this a pie chart:
